This project requires SDL2 to be installed.

To build, you must first initialize the submodules.  To do that, run the
following commands:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

Instead, you can directly clone this project and the submodules at the same time
with this command:

    git clone --recursive URL_FOR_THIS_PROJECT

Then simply run make, and an executable should be produced.

To update to the latest version of the submodules in this project, run this
command:

    git submodule foreach git pull
