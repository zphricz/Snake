Overview
--------

This is the classic game Snake implemented with my software renderer. There's
not a whole lot more to say. It requires SDL2 to run. Run it with:

    ./snake

To specify the number of cells in the game and the resolution to render it by,
run it with:

    ./life [Board_x Board_y] [Screen_x Screen_y]
