Overview
--------

This is the classic game Snake implemented with my software renderer. There's
not a whole lot more to say. It requires SDL2 to run. Run it with:

    ./snake

To specify the number of cells in the game and the resolution to render it by,
run it with:

    ./life [Board_x Board_y] [Screen_x Screen_y]

Use the arrow keys to move the snake. Press space or enter to pause and start
the game.  To close the program, press the escape key.

I've implemented a very simple AI player for the game. To enable or disable the
AI player, press 1.
